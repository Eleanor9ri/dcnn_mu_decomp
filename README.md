# dcnn_mu_decomp

The repository includes basic code for motor unit decomposition using deep CNN.

hdEMG_DCNN includes different callable modules: 
  Load EMG and spike data from mat file; 
  Build and train deep CNN model; 
  Evaluate deep cnn model and save the results to csv file; 
  etc.

hdEMG_validate is the runable code to train and validate the deep CNN:
  Initialize the parameters: step size, window size
  Build and train the deep CNN model
  Test the deep CNN model for prediction/estimation accuracy performance and time efficiency performance
  
 
This repository intends to service as supplementary materials for our publication in Journal of Neural Engineering. 
Detailed information to be added.
